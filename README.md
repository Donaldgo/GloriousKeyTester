# GloriousKeyTester
Key Tester for Glorious LLC products.
They Key Tester works by using JS event listeners to call functions that change the colors of the keys.
My goal is to create divs around the Keys and change the divs' colors instead of changing the color of the letters.
The keys currently have 3 states. Unactivated, currently activate, and previously activated.
After I get the keyboard set, I will work on mouse functionality. Specifically the Auxilary buttons.
The site has been tested in Fire Fox and Chrome but primarily chrome. There are still some functionality issues with Fire Fox due to browser shortcuts.
